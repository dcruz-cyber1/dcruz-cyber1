Hi, I’m Daniel Cruz
Aspiring SOC Analyst | Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Blue Team Focus
Welcome to my GitHub. I’m a high school student passionate about cybersecurity, especially in threat detection, incident response, and malware analysis.

What I’m Working On
I’m building hands 
on experience through practical projects that simulate real world security operations center (SOC) workflows, including:

Phishing Email Analysis
Investigating spoofed Microsoft Outlook Support emails to identify threat indicators and social engineering tactics.

Malware Traffic PCAP Analysis
Deep packet inspection of malicious Command and Control (C2) network traffic using Wireshark and threat intelligence tools.

Host Based Detection and Incident Triage
Simulating attacker techniques on Windows using Sysmon and PowerShell, then analyzing event logs for suspicious activity.

Skills and Tools
Packet analysis (Wireshark)
Log analysis (Sysmon, Windows Event Viewer)
Threat intelligence platforms (VirusTotal, AbuseIPDB, MXToolbox)
Email header and phishing analysis
Command line and scripting basics (PowerShell)
Incident triage and IOC extraction

Featured Projects
Phishing Email Forensics
Detailed forensic analysis of phishing emails impersonating Microsoft support.

Malware Traffic PCAP Analysis
Exploring malicious HTTP and TCP traffic to identify malware C2 communications.

Windows Host Detection Simulation
Simulated attack behaviors on Windows workstation detected through Sysmon event logs.

Goals
Expand my portfolio with SIEM, IDS/IPS, and firewall projects
Gain Security+ and CISSP certifications
Cybersecurity internship or entry level SOC role
